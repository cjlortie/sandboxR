###Challenge 1. Iteration  
I want to apply a function to a dataframe indexed by a single vector for now but could imagine by more than one vector.  Seems like a nice lapply solution, but I have some difficiulty in getting it to work. Next, I tried purr::map.  No dice.  I do not want to use for loops.

```{r, CH1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data/iteration.csv")

```
